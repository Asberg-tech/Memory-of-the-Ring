Short Process Summary for the Assignment

Idea & Concept
We decided on creating a memory-style card game inspired by the fantasy realm of a ring-bearing saga. The goal is to have pairs of matching images—each depicting a recognizable character or symbol.

Front-End Focus
We chose to implement the project purely on the client side, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No server-side code is involved, keeping the setup straightforward and easy to maintain.

Design & Layout
- The game is laid out in a grid of cards (e.g., a 4×4 arrangement).
- Each card has a "front" and a "back."
- Clicking on two cards in succession reveals if they match.

Visuals & Prompts
To populate the card faces, we drafted eight image prompts (plus an additional one for Gimli) to generate or create fantasy-styled artwork. Each prompt is carefully phrased to avoid direct copyright references.

Implementation Plan
- HTML structures the grid and card elements.
- CSS provides styling, positioning, and (optionally) flip animations.
- JavaScript handles the game logic: flipping cards, tracking matches, and resetting the game.

Development Process

1. Project Structure Setup
   - Created a clear directory structure:
     * `pages/` for HTML files
     * `styles/` for CSS files
     * `scripts/` for JavaScript files
     * `images/` for game assets
   - This organization ensures clean separation of concerns and makes the project maintainable

2. Basic Game Interface (HTML)
   - Implemented the main game layout in `index.html`
   - Created a responsive container for the game board
   - Added game information elements:
     * Title section
     * Moves counter
     * Timer display
     * Reset button
   - Used semantic HTML5 elements for better structure

3. Styling Implementation (CSS)
   - Designed a modern, clean interface using CSS variables for consistent theming
   - Implemented responsive grid layout for cards
   - Created smooth card flip animations using CSS transforms
   - Added media queries for mobile responsiveness
   - Enhanced visual atmosphere:
     * Themed background image covering the entire viewport
     * Fixed background attachment for smooth scrolling
     * Proper image scaling and positioning for all screen sizes
   - Implemented custom card design:
     * Square aspect ratio for visual consistency
     * Enhanced corner rounding (15px radius)
     * Subtle shadow effects for depth
     * Optimized image display with padding
     * Used themed card back image
     * Proper image scaling and positioning
   - Used CSS features:
     * CSS Grid for card layout
     * Flexbox for header elements
     * CSS Variables for theming
     * 3D transforms for card flipping
     * Box-shadow for depth
     * Mobile-first responsive design
     * Background image handling
     * Fixed background attachments

4. Game Logic (JavaScript)
   - Implemented core game mechanics using a class-based approach
   - Key features implemented:
     * Card shuffling algorithm
     * Card flip mechanics
     * Match checking logic
     * Move counting
     * Timer functionality
     * Game state management
   - Used modern JavaScript features:
     * ES6 Classes
     * Array spread operator
     * Template literals
     * Arrow functions
     * DOM manipulation

5. Image Implementation
   - Added character images to the game:
     * Main characters: Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli
     * Antagonists: Sauron, Gollum
     * Key items: The Ring
   - Integrated images into the card system:
     * Updated card data structure with image paths
     * Ensured proper relative path handling
     * Maintained theme consistency across all cards
   - Images are loaded dynamically when cards are created
   - Card back design provides contrast to character images

Next Steps
- Implement additional game features:
  * High score tracking
  * Difficulty levels
  * Sound effects
- Polish the user interface
- Add loading states and transitions

Outcome
This approach leads to a simple yet thematic project that showcases basic web development skills (HTML/CSS/JS), design considerations (style consistency, responsiveness), and creative adaptation of a fantasy setting.
