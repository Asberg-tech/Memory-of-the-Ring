    Memory of the Ring - Game Interface

    This is the main HTML file for the memory card game. It provides:
    - Basic game structure and layout
    - Game information display (moves and timer)
    - Card grid container
    - Victory modal
    
    The game board is dynamically populated with cards by JavaScript,
    while maintaining a responsive and accessible layout structure.

    AI Assistance Documentation:
    This HTML structure was developed with AI assistance in several areas:
    1. Semantic HTML structure for better accessibility
    2. Modal implementation for victory screen
    3. Dynamic content integration points
    4. Mobile-friendly viewport configuration

    All AI suggestions were manually reviewed and implemented with human oversight.
    The structural decisions and final implementation were made by the developer.
